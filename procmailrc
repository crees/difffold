# This one is tested
# To use on freefall, set your /var/forward/user to:
# "|IFS=' ' && p=/usr/local/bin/procmail && test -f $p && exec $p -Yf- || exit 75
# and set your email address below and make sure the Python script
# is in your path
#
# All other mail should pass through untouched.
#
# It is *imperative* that the python script exists, or you may lose mail.
